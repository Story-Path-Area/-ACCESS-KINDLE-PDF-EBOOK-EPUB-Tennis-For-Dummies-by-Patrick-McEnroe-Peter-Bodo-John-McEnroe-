Tennis For Dummies by Patrick McEnroe,Peter Bodo,John McEnroe Book Review

Name: Mike Murray
Rating: 4.0 out of 5 stars
Title: A Must For Beginners
Date: Reviewed in the United States on September 17, 2011
Review: Tennis for Dummies provides answers to most of the questions all new entrants to the sport will have prior to taking their first lesson or just going out to hit a few balls across the net with a more experienced friend. To obtain a detailed presentation of the game rules, appropriate grips, groundstrokes, serving and the basics on singles and doubles matches, buy this book. Your Pro instructor or player friend will appreciate your initiative in obtaining a preliminary understanding of the fundamentals of tennis, which should cut down the time it takes for you to become at least recreationally proficient in the sport. Outside of an illustration that had the deuce and ad courts labeled backwards, the only weak area I noted pertained to playing doubles. While the sequence of serving was adequately covered, exactly how it fit into the chosen receiving court remaining constant for each set left me guessing exactly how that would work. Other than that,I'd rate this as one of the better tennis primers out there.

Title: Very good over-all for the beginner to intermediate player
Date: Reviewed in the United States on April 7, 2011
Review: I used to teach tennis during and after college (was on a state championship team) and do so occasionally now for friends and family. I've recommended this book to beginners and intermediate players. I like Patrick's style and breadth of coverage, but I wish he went into much more detail, with more photos or illustrations regarding the various stroke techniques (top spin forehand, serve, etc.). Some of his verbal descriptions of stroke mechanics could be interpreted a variety of ways which can be confusing to a beginner when there is not an experienced player available to help interpret. Perhaps he answers these problems in his recent update and revision (I have read the first edition only). There is simply not much good instructional material available on tennis, unlike golf. This book does provide a lot of info on a variety of important tennis topics, and is the best of what I have seen on the market. I recommend it, but nothing beats having good, personal professional instruction. A solid reference source.

Review: Very helpful but lots of dense reading for a refresher. Good news is that this book was more than I needed but did the trick in refreshing me for the game

Date: Reviewed in the United States on July 20, 2016
Review: I ordered this book primarily for my sister who is a beginner tennis player. That said, it does cover all the basics and much more (perhaps too much for a beginner). It covered etiquette, game rules, even pre-tennis exercises, and injury treatments, tournaments etc.. The diagrams were useful; a few more illustrations would be great in groundstroke/serve production. That said, being an intermediate player I found plenty of useful here in areas I never studied. As to instructions, they can vary slightly even in tennis and I appreciate different views. I would keep this book for myself as a reliable go-to, along with a few other tennis books. Definitely my sister can use it.

Title: It is funny, and informative
Date: Reviewed in the United States on July 3, 2016
Review: I knew the contents already of this book because I had borrowed one from my local library. I am a new tennis player and thought it would be helpful to own a copy for reference. It is funny, and informative, and although there are so many rules in tennis for game scoring, yikes!!! Patrick McEnroe does a swell job in his narrative.

Title: EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED
Date: Reviewed in the United States on June 20, 2014
Review: This book is exactly as described. The only thing I would suggest to the seller to improve reputation is to remove the previous sale stickers from the book, as there were two purple stickers left on the book (one on the front and one on the spine of the book). Other thank that, good seller.

Review: This is good book to help you understand this some what complicated game. It gives a lot of diagrams and explanations. Do be careful of the stickers though. I tried to take my price tag off and I ripped the whole cover of the book
